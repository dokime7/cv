    Having practiced a lot of self-training during my 16 years of experience and listening to 
    experienced people around me, self-taught in many fields, I have built up a knowledge 
    base over the years.

    This has allowed me to have my skills recognized and to be able to put forward my 
    expertise in incident management and technical vision.

    I started working on Unix environments as a SAP administrator in 2004 to become today 
    Infrastructure and Security Administrator. Today I work mainly on Linux and Open 
    Source software.

    As an autonomous person, I know how to get information where it is accurate and 
    how to be reactive in order to adapt to complex situations, whether they are 
    technical, human or organizational.

    I have successfully entered the development cycle, combining this with my 
    responsiveness, I have enabled the team to meet its delivery deadlines. 
    I work closely with the developers throughout the application’s lifecycle.

    I plan to pass the OSCP certification.

    * My experience of server security was originally a personal need, because I practice self-hosting: [Github](https://github.com/pihomecloud/pihomecloud)
    * Being passionate about home automation, I have a solution that does not require a cloud provider.
    * I maintain archlinux packages either on [the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?K=saez0pub&SeB=m) or on github : [Me](https://github.com/saez0pub?tab=repositories) or [Another Me](https://github.com/pihomecloud?tab=repositories)
    * I have tested technologies such as OCR, computer vision and speech recognition. These tests are available on my [github](https://github.com/saez0pub?tab=repositories).
